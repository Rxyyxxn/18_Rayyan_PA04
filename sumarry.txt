Unit testing is to test the smallest units or software components
in a program.Unit testing is the execution of a complete class, routine or small program that has been
written by a single programmer or team of programmers, which is tested in isolation
from the more complete system.
It is type of whitebox testing.

Integration testing is the combined execution of two or more classes, packages,
components, or subsystems that have been created by multiple programmers or
programming teams.
It may fall under both
white box testing and black box testing.
